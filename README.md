## Description

I built the website to be simple but still have the outlook of a developer's website. Having a front-end, the overview page(index.html#flow) and a back-end, the info page(index.html#maintain).

## Process

I built my website to follow the sliding movement of a rubric cube. On going to the home page you'll notice the similar movement.
I was able to merge the three pages into one index.html(index.html) file.
I added gulpfile.js for image optimization

## Dependencies

Dependendt on gulp and gulp-imagemin for image minimization
